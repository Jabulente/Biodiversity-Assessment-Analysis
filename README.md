# **Biodiversity Assessment and Analysis**

## **Overview**
This project aims to assess and analyze biodiversity across different ecosystems using various biodiversity indices, statistical tests, and visualization techniques. By employing indices like the **Simpson Index** and **Shannon-Wiener Index**, as well as performing correlation and regression analyses, the project provides insights into the biodiversity patterns of different ecosystems and how environmental factors influence them.

The repository includes reusable Python code blocks to calculate and visualize biodiversity metrics, run statistical tests, and perform multivariate analysis like Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

## **Key Features**
- **Biodiversity Indices**: Calculating Simpson Index, Shannon-Wiener Index, Species Richness, and Evenness for biodiversity evaluation.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Implementing t-tests, ANOVA, correlation analysis, and regression models to understand factors influencing biodiversity.
- **Multivariate Analysis**: Performing PCA to identify key environmental variables affecting biodiversity.
- **Visualization**: Generating clear and insightful visualizations, such as species accumulation curves and biodiversity distributions across ecosystems.
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Includes scripts for cleaning and preparing datasets for analysis.

## **Objective**
The primary objective of this project is to:
1. Quantify and compare biodiversity across multiple ecosystems using established biodiversity indices.
2. Investigate the relationships between environmental variables (such as temperature, precipitation) and biodiversity.
3. Use statistical methods and visualizations to provide insights into the distribution and diversity of species in different ecosystems.
4. Make the analysis process reproducible and flexible for different datasets and ecosystems.

## **Dataset**
This project uses ecological data that includes:
- **Species Count**: The number of individuals from different species in each ecosystem.
- **Environmental Factors**: Variables such as temperature, precipitation, and soil conditions that may influence biodiversity.
- **Ecosystem Types**: Different ecosystems where data has been collected, e.g., forest, grassland, wetland.

### **Dataset Columns**
- `Ecosystem`: The type of ecosystem (e.g., forest, wetland).
- `Species_Count`: Count of individuals per species in the ecosystem.
- `Temperature`: Average temperature of the ecosystem.
- `Precipitation`: Average precipitation in the ecosystem.
- `Soil_Condition`: Soil quality in the ecosystem.

## **Methodology**
The analysis employs several key methodologies:
1. **Biodiversity Indices**: 
   - **Simpson Index**: Measures the probability that two individuals randomly selected from a sample will belong to the same species.
   - **Shannon-Wiener Index**: Measures the uncertainty in predicting the species of a randomly chosen individual.
   - **Species Richness**: The number of unique species in an ecosystem.
   - **Evenness**: Measures the distribution of individuals among the species in an ecosystem.

2. **Statistical Tests**:
   - **t-tests**: To compare biodiversity between two ecosystems.
   - **ANOVA**: To assess differences in biodiversity across more than two ecosystems.
   - **Correlation Analysis**: To examine relationships between environmental factors and biodiversity indices.
   - **Regression Analysis**: To predict biodiversity indices based on environmental factors.

3. **Multivariate Analysis**:
   - **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**: Used for dimensionality reduction and to identify the most important variables affecting biodiversity.

4. **Visualization**:
   - **Species Accumulation Curves**: To observe how species diversity accumulates with increasing sample sizes.
   - **Biodiversity Distribution Plots**: To visualize biodiversity metrics across ecosystems.

## **Installation**

To get started with this project, follow these installation instructions:

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Biodiversity-Assessment-Analysis.git
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**
This project requires Python 3.x and the following libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can generate the `requirements.txt` file by running the following command:
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

### **3. Dataset**
- Download the dataset and place it in the `data/` directory of the repository.
- The dataset should be in CSV format, with columns for ecosystem, species count, and environmental factors.

## **Usage**

### **1. Running the Analysis**
The analysis is performed in the `biodiversity_analysis.py` script. This script loads the dataset, performs the required calculations, statistical tests, and generates visualizations.

```bash
python biodiversity_analysis.py
```

### **2. Example Outputs**
- **Biodiversity Indices**: The calculated biodiversity indices for each ecosystem will be printed to the console.
- **Statistical Test Results**: The t-test and ANOVA results, including p-values, will be displayed.
- **PCA Results**: The explained variance ratio from the PCA analysis will be shown.
- **Visualizations**: Bar plots, species accumulation curves, and other plots will be saved as image files.

### **3. Customizing the Analysis**
- Modify the input dataset in the `data/` directory.
- Adjust parameters (e.g., environmental variables) in the Python scripts to match your specific analysis needs.
- Reuse individual functions for custom calculations and visualizations.
